## Jovo and the Actions Builder: Goodbye Dialogflow

![Difference between Google Actions with Dialogflow and Actions Builder](https://www.jovo.tech/img/tutorials/google-conversational-actions-getting-started/google-actions-dialogflow.jpg "Previous Google Actions used Dialogflow as a mddle layer between Google Assistant and Jovo")

Jovo has been offering support for Google Assistant since our launch more than 3 years ago. From the beginning on, we integrated with Google's natural language understanding service Dialogflow, the then standard way to build Google Actions. Although this already worked great ([including support for additional integrations](https://www.jovo.tech/marketplace/jovo-platform-dialogflow)), our users had to create and configure a Dialogflow agent as an additional step.

Recently, Google introduced a new way to build apps for Google Assistant: [Conversational Actions](https://developers.google.com/assistant/conversational). This new release removed the necessity to connect with Dialogflow for natural language understanding.

In addition, you can use their graphical user interface called Action Builder to create intents and scenes:

With Jovo, you can now build Google Conversational Actions that work with the Actions Builder. By using our [Google Assistant integration for the Jovo Model](https://www.jovo.tech/marketplace/jovo-model/google-assistant), you can create all necessary files for the Actions Builder. And the conversational logic can be built the same way you've been using our previous Google Assistant integration.
