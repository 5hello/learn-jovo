## Introduction

During our [`v2` release](https://medium.com/@einkoenig/introducing-jovo-framework-v2-c98326ac4aca) two months ago, we also announced a new interface for [Jovo CMS integrations](https://www.jovo.tech/docs/cms). The main goal of this is to allow teams to decouple their voice app content from the app logic to be able to update content more easily, without the need to constantly update the code.

While we first started with our [Google Sheets integration](https://www.jovo.tech/docs/cms/google-sheets) ([find the tutorial here](https://www.jovo.tech/tutorials/google-sheets-cms)), we're excited to launch an integration to Airtable today.

[Airtable](https://airtable.com) is a powerful tool that uses advantages of both spreadsheets and databases. Relations between tables, file uploads, and many more features open up a lot of possibilities for content management.

With this integration, you can now easily store your content in Airtable tables and reference them inside your Jovo voice apps in a comfortable way.
