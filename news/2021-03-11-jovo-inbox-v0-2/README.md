`0.2` of Jovo Inbox comes with several improvements with the goal to make it as easy as possible to learn from user conversations, across devices and platforms.

* Connect Jovo Inbox to more platforms, including Google Assistant and the web
* Surface the right conversations with filters
* See all sessions at a glance using the sessions overview

See below for more details.


### More Platforms

![Jovo Inbox for Google Assistant](./img/jovo-inbox-google-assistant.jpg "A screenshot of Jovo Inbox showing a Google Assistant conversation")

We added the following platforms:

* [Google Conversational Actions](https://www.jovo.tech/marketplace/jovo-platform-googleassistantconv)
* [Google Actions using Dialogflow](https://www.jovo.tech/marketplace/jovo-platform-googleassistant)
* [Jovo for Web](https://www.jovo.tech/news/2020-10-29-jovo-for-web-v3-2)

The goal is to support [all Jovo platform integrations](https://www.jovo.tech/marketplace/tag/platforms). Let us know which one we should add next!


### Filters


![Jovo Inbox Filters](./img/jovo-inbox-filters.jpg "Current filter options: Conversations with errors, platform type")

The more users your experience has, the more difficult it is to surface the most important interactions. Our goal is to make it as easy as possible to discover the conversations that should be investigated.

As a first step, we added filters to our search, allowing you to filter by:

* Platform, e.g. Alexa, Google Assistant, Web
* Conversations with errors


### Improved Detail View

![Jovo Inbox Detail View](./img/jovo-inbox-detail-view.jpg "A detail view includes access to the JSON and the APL screen")

Double clicking a bubble now opens a sidebar with a detail view, showing:
* A JSON view of the request or response for debugging and sharing with developers
* APL screens

You can also use your arrow keys to quickly switch between interactions.

### Sessions Overview

![Jovo Inbox Sessions Overview](./img/jovo-inbox-sessions-overview.jpg "See all sessions at a single glance")

You can now access an overview of all sessions. This allows you to see everything at a glance, even for frequent users with many sessions.

The overview currently shows the following information for each session:
* Date
* Number of interactions
* Device
* Errors



### More Improvements

And there are even more things that we've been working on, including:

* APL-A Support
* Improved user search
* Improved UX: scrolling, loading indictators
* Show multiple bubbles for platforms that support multiple responses
