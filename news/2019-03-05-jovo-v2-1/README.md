### Alpha: Build Bots for Platforms like Facebook Messenger and Slack

> Jovo Docs: [Dialogflow Integrations](https://www.jovo.tech/docs/dialogflow-integrations/)

![Build a Slack Bot with Jovo](./img/slack-bot.gif "Build a Slack Bot with the Jovo Framework")

New experimental feature: By using [Dialogflow Integrations](https://www.jovo.tech/docs/dialogflow-integrations/), you can now bring your Jovo apps to bot platforms like Facebook Messenger and Slack!

Right now, this is an alpha release, so you will only be able to create text responses. Please note that, although they are similar, text based conversational experiences can differ from voice applications. Currently, there is no real difference between `tell` and `ask`, for example. We will work towards a clearer designed abstraction in upcoming releases.

However, you can already add [custom payloads](https://dialogflow.com/docs/intents/rich-messages#custom_payload) to the Dialogflow response with `this.$dialogflowAgent.setCustomPayload`, which can be used for platform specific output.

For example, you can add [Facebook Messenger Quick Replies](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-messages/quick-replies) like this:

```js
// src/app.js

app.setHandler({

   HelloWorldIntent() {
      this.$dialogflowAgent.setCustomPayload("facebook", {
         "quick_replies": [
               {
                  "content_type": "text",
                  "title": "Joe",
                  "payload": "Joe",
               },
               {
                  "content_type": "text",
                  "title": "Samantha",
                  "payload": "Samantha",
               },
               {
                  "content_type": "text",
                  "title": "Chris",
                  "payload": "Chris",
               }
         ]
      });
      this.ask('Hello World! What\'s your name?', 'Please tell me your name.');
   },

   // Other Intents

});
```


### Extend the Jovo Framework with Hooks

> Docs: [Hooks](https://www.jovo.tech/docs/hooks)

[![Video: Jovo Hooks](./img/video-jovo-hooks.jpg 'youtube-video')](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBrX5srF3yU)

[Jovo Hooks](https://www.jovo.tech/docs/hooks) offer the ability to customize and extend the Jovo Framework in a lightweight way, without having to build a full-fledged plugin.

This can be helpful if you wan to do quick modifications during certain parts of the request lifecycle. For example, you could add additional JSON output necessary for an Alexa Skill private beta feature before the response is sent put by hooking into `before.response`.


### New Integrations

Besides the larger updates above, we also added and updated some [integrations](https://www.jovo.tech/docs/integrations):

* [Google Cloud Firestore (Firebase)](https://www.jovo.tech/tutorials/deploy-to-google-cloud)
* Azure Functions Context Logging
* Added an `ObjectArray` sheet type to the [Google Sheets CMS integration](https://www.jovo.tech/docs/cms/google-sheets)



### And more, including Unit Testing Improvements and Logging

There were tons of smaller updates, but the following ones were among the most anticipated updates:

* [You can now access user data in unit tests](https://www.jovo.tech/docs/unit-testing#user-data) with `conversation.$user.$data`
* [A `Jovo Logger`class](https://www.jovo.tech/docs/data/logging#jovo-logger) that allows for verbose logging and improved debugging

Interested in *all the updates*? See the [Jovo Framework Changelog](https://github.com/jovotech/jovo-framework/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for a more detailed overview.
