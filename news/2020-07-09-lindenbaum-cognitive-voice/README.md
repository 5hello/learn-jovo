## Introduction

When the industry talks about voice user interfaces, the focus is usually on the major smart speaker assistants Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant. While these platforms are doing a great job at increasing the mainstream acceptance of speech recognition technology, companies sometimes struggle to find clear use cases on how to integrate with them today.

What is often neglected: One of the most business critical voice channels is the phone. Millions of customer support calls happen every day, and automating the contact center can help both deliver a better customer experience and reduce service cost.


"_Before Covid contact centers already were the key window between customers and an enterprise; and this only has increased since Covid. Contact centers have increased in reach and scope, but call volumes have increased too. In fact the majority of contact center touch points is still through calls, and enterprises quite too easily forget that efficiency is definitely possible, while increasing service levels._" - Maarten Kronenburg, CEO Lindenbaum GmbH

One leading company that specializes in making phone calls smarter is [Lindenbaum](https://www.lindenbaum.eu/). Their [Cognitive Voice](https://www.lindenbaum.eu/en/cognitive-voice-voice-bot-integration/) platform enables businesses to build telephony and voice bots that adhere to highest standards in security and privacy with servers based in Germany.

With the [Jovo Lindenbaum platform integration](https://www.jovo.tech/marketplace/jovo-platform-lindenbaum), it is now possible to connect a Jovo app to a Lindenbaum phone number. This comes with several benefits, including:
Cross-platform development: Build once and deploy to many platforms
Open source and highly flexible: Extend and host your voice experience anywhere
Many integrations for better development workflows: CMS, databases, analytics, and more
