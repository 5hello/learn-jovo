In this tutorial, we'll look at building an ai-driven IVR using Jovo and Twilio Autopilot.

You're probably familiar with the acronym IVR. But, just in case, it stands for Interactive voice response system. It's what you encounter when you call most businesses these days. You know... press one for sales, two for service, and so on.

But, with artificial intelligence, an IVR can go way beyond just providing menu options. Think Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant but accessed via the telephone. AI takes the possibilities for IVRs to a whole new level. So forget about the IVRs you're used to and imagine an intelligent virtual receptionist that can answer just about any question you have for it. That's where they're all going.
