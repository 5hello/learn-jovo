## Introduction

The [`project.js`](https://github.com/jovotech/jovo-framework-nodejs/blob/master/docs/configuration/project-js.md 'docs/configuration/project-js') is Jovo project configuration file that stores information like which platforms are used (`alexaSkill`, `googleAction`), including additional information like project IDs, endpoints, etc.

One of the useful features of the `project.js` is the ability to add stages to deploy your voice app to different environments (like `local` on your computer and `dev` on Lambda). Environment variables are a great way to define values that are directly linked to the current environment. 

Referencing environment variables in your project can be helpful if you want to use the `project.js` as a generic template and then leave it to each environment how to set its values.

## How to use env variables

You need to do two steps to use env variables in your `project.js` file:

* [Referencing env keys](#referencing-env-keys)
* [Setting env values](#setting-env-values)

### Referencing env key

You can reference env variables in your `project.js` with `${process.env.KEY}`. For example, if you want to reference the Alexa Skill ID, you can do it like this:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  alexaSkill: {
    nlu: 'alexa',
    skillId: process.env.SKILL_ID
  },
  // other configurations
};
```

### Setting env values

For local development, you can use a `.env` file in your root project directory that could look like this:

```
STAGE=local
```

If you're hosting your voice app on a service like AWS Lambda, you can define the environment variables there:

## Use Cases

Environment variables can be especially helpful for local development (in a `local` stage) where every developer e.g. has their own Alexa Skill ID and uses their own ASK CLI profile to deploy it to the Amazon Developer Portal:

```javascript
"stages": {
    "local": {
        "alexaSkill": {
                "skillId": "${process.env.SKILL_ID}",
                "askProfile": "${process.env.ASK_PROFILE}"
        }
    }
}
```
The initial `.env` file could then look like this:

```
STAGE=local
SKILL_ID=
ASK_PROFILE=default
```

A new `jovo build` and `jovo deploy` would then use the empty Skill ID to create a new Alexa Skill. If the developer then pastes the Skill ID into the `.env` file, it is always used to deploy the Skill in the `local` stage.

For hosted projects on e.g. AWS Lambda (in a `dev` or `prod` stage), environment variables can also be helpful to remove the need to change elements directly in the code. For example, you could define your DynamoDB table name in the environment variables like this:

```javascript
"stages": {
    "dev": {
        "config": {
                "db": {
                        "type": "dynamodb",
                        "tableName": "${process.env.TABLE_NAME}"
                }
        }
    }
}
```

The `TABLE_NAME` value can then be added in the Lambda function:
