# Project 2: Adventure Game

Welcome to our second project-based course about voice app development. After completing [Project 1: Hello World](https://www.jovo.tech/blog/project-1-hello-world/), you now have a basic understanding of how voice apps work and how to set Alexa and Google Assistant up for simple responses.

Now, let's build something more engaging! In this course, we're going to build a simple choose-your-own-adventure like voice app to learn more about how to route our users through intents and states.

## What We're Building

_"What did just happen?"_ 

_Somehow, your memory of the last few hours seems to be a little blurry, and you can't remember how you ended up here. You take a look around, but don't recognize anything. You seem to be inside some form of patio, with nowhere to go._

_But wait._

_In front of you, there are two doors, the left one is blue, the right one is red. You seem to feel like you're hearing a sound from inside the red door. What should you do?_

_"You can either go through the blue door, or the red door. What do you want to do?"_

In this project, we're going to build an interactive game and learn more about intents, states, and parameters. It's similar to popular choose-your-own-adventure stories like books where you flip back and forth. Although this example is a simple one with just two steps, it shows what's possible with games like this.

However, you will notice how important compelling scripting is to design engaging experiences for voice interfaces. For great scripting, take a look at voice gaming pioneers like [Earplay](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01K8V6NSI). In this project, we will focus more on the interaction model and development of the voice app, not too heavily on the scripting.
