# Jovo Podcast Player Course

Welcome to our third project-based course about voice app development. In this course we're going to build a easily modifiable podcast player.

It will automatically play multiple episodes in a row, let the user pause and resume whenever they want and let them switch between episodes freely.

While building that, we will learn about
* how to incorporate platform specific features into your multi-platform app,
* how to structure bigger projects,
* the Alexa AudioPlayer and Google MediaResponse interface to stream audio files,
* the Jovo Language Model,
and much more.
