# Project 3: Build a Podcast Player

Welcome to our third project-based course about voice app development. In previous courses, we already learned some of the basics of building Alexa Skills and Google Actions. After an initial setup in [Project 1: Hello World](https://www.jovo.tech/courses/project-1-hello-world/), we looked at some more advanced routing in [Project 2: Adventure Game](https://www.jovo.tech/courses/project-2-adventure-game).

For project 3, we'll look into one of the most popular use cases for voice apps and smart speakers: streaming audio. Let's build a podcast player voice app that works on both Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.

## What We're Building

![](./img/podcast-player-voice-app.jpg)

In this course we're going to build a easily modifiable podcast player Alexa Skill and Google Action.

It will automatically play multiple episodes in a row, let the user pause and resume whenever they want, and let them switch between episodes freely.

While building that, we will learn about
* the Alexa AudioPlayer and Google MediaResponse interfaces to stream audio files,
* how to incorporate platform specific features into your multi-platform app,
* how to structure bigger projects,
* the Jovo Language Model,

and much more. See all the steps below.
